# CIS VMware 6.7 settings
CIS V1.0.0 <br>
Just L1 settings

## Running
It's assumed that you run scripts from the current drectory. E.G.
```powershell
Connect-VIServer -Server <Server>
.\CIS_1\CIS_1.1.ps1
```

## ToDo
* Build a script to launch all checks from the root dir instead of running each individually
